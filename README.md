# codsoft_-.-2-Calculator

 code defines a simple calculator program in Python with functions for basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here's a summary of the code:

Functions for Arithmetic Operations:

add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
subtract(x, y): Returns the difference of x and y.
multiply(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
divide(x, y): Returns the quotient of x and y, with a check to prevent division by zero.
Main Calculator Function:

calculator(): Guides the user through selecting an operation and entering numbers, performs the selected operation, and displays the result. The user can repeat calculations until they choose to stop.
User Interaction:

The program prompts the user to select an arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) by entering a choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).
The user is then prompted to input two numbers, with validation to ensure the inputs are integers.
Based on the selected operation, the appropriate function is called, and the result is printed.
The user is asked if they want to perform another calculation. If the response is not 'yes', the program ends.
If the user inputs an invalid choice for the operation, an error message is displayed.
